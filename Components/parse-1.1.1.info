Once you have an ID, you can\ninitialize your Parse client:\n\n```csharp\nusing ParseTouch;\n...\n\npublic override bool FinishedLaunching (UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)\n{\n\t...\n\tParse.SetAppId (\"YOUR_APP_ID\", \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\");\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n## Saving an Object\n\nHere\u0027s all it takes to save an object to Parse:\n\n```csharp\nvoid MakePost ()\n{\n\tvar post = new ParseObject (\"Post\");\n\tpost [\"title\"] = new NSString (\"I love Parse with Xamarin\");\n\tpost [\"body\"] = new NSString (\"Need I say more?\");\n\tpost.SaveAsync ((success, error) =\u003e {\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine (\"Success : {0}\", success);\n\t});\n}\n```\n\n## User Management\n\nAdding user accounts to your app has never been easier.
